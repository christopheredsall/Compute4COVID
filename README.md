# Compute4COVID
A collection of compute resources for people doing research related to COVID virus curated by a small consortia of computing centers wishing to support efforts to combat COVID. It is intended to connect people to available resources.

We'll be editing this page with links to compute resources being made available for COVID related research and other efforts.
Please know that these resources are limited but every little bit counts. If you have a resource, even if it's reserved to a geographic location or a particular topic, please let me know so we can add it here. Respond to the ticket with Name of the resource, link to how to apply for access, and limitations if any.

Efforts can include bioinformatics, medical imaging research, NLP, drug discovery.

### Academic Services
#### [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org)

CyVerse provides cyberinfrastructure tools and services for _free_ to researchers in the USA, there are some limitations on international users. Our extensible data science workbenches and data store can integrate and run your bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud services, APIs, and more. Resources are managed at University of Arizona and the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/), and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Infrastructures are linked to the [NSF XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) framework, as well as the [OpenScienceGrid](https://opensciencegrid.org/) over Internet2.

#### [Jetstream Cloud] (https://www.jetstream-cloud.org)

Jetstream is a National Science Foundation research and education cloud resource that provides **free allocations for PIs at US-based research institutions**. Both simple VM launch capabilities via the Atmosphere GUI interface and API interfaces are available. Resources are available for all US-based researchers regardless of funding organization (or lack thereof).
  * Allocated via XSEDE.
