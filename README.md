# Compute4COVID
A collection of compute resources for people doing research related to COVID virus curated by a small consortia of computing centers wishing to support efforts to combat COVID. It is intended to connect people to available resources.

We'll be editing this page with links to compute resources being made available for COVID related research and other efforts.
Please know that these resources are limited but every little bit counts. If you have a resource, even if it's reserved to a geographic location or a particular topic, please let me know so we can add it here. Respond to the ticket with Name of the resource, link to how to apply for access, and limitations if any.

Efforts can include bioinformatics, medical imaging research, NLP, drug discovery.

## Software
